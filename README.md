# darkr

`darkr` is an R package that wraps [Trevas](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas), a Java VTL engine.

## What is VTL ?

> VTL is a standard language for defining validation and transformation rules (set of operators, their syntax and semantics) for any kind of statistical data

For more information, follow [this](https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5096).

## How to use it?

`darkr` will be available on CRAN as soon as a sufficiently large set of features is developed and tested.

For now, you need to clone this repository, open the project in RStudio, then load the package using `devtools::load_all()`.

You could also install it via `devtools::install_github("romaintailhurat/darkr")`.

Once done, try:

```R
res <- darkr::vtl_eval("a := 3 * 3; b := 33; c := a + b;")
# 42
```

You can also use a VTL expression over a dataframe:

```R
df <- darkr:::mock_df()
# names(df)
# [1] "id"   "name" "age"
ds <- darkr::df_to_ds(df)
new_ds <- darkr::vtl_eval("new_ds := ds[ drop age ];", ds)
new_df <- darkr::ds_to_df(new_ds)
# names(new_df)
# [1] "id"   "name"
```

## Limits

This is a _work in progress_, some important parts are missing:

- we create a VTL identifier based on column names `id` or `name` if they exist, overriding is not possible,
- multiple bindings are not supported,
- the Java implementation of a dataset currently used is very basic, it is probably not intended to be on par with native R performance.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic wrapping of Trevas
- [x] Dataframes operations :
  - [x] basic support of Trevas dataset operations
  - [x] transformation function from a dataframe to a [Trevas dataset](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas/blob/master/vtl-model/src/main/java/fr/insee/vtl/model/Dataset.java)
  - [x] back from a dataset to a dataframe
- [ ] Evaluation
  - [ ] Support multiple bindings when evaluating a VTL expression
  - [ ] Directly support R values for bindings (eg data frames)
  - [ ] Implement a VTL expression builder
- [ ] Benchmarking
  - [ ] Compare pure R operations VS Trevas

## How to developp?

TODO

### Java dependency

For now, in order to include Trevas as a jar, you need to clone the GitHub repo, and produce the jar file using `mvn package` and then copy it.

In two steps :

```
cd ~/code/vtl/Trevas/vtl-engine/
mvn package
```

then:

```
cd ~/code/vtl/darkr/
cp ../Trevas/vtl-engine/target/vtl-engine-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ./java/
```

## Why the name?

Because the package is using [Trevas](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas), the Java VTL engine, and [trevas](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trevas) means "darkness" in Portuguese.
